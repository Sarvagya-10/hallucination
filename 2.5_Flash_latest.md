```We are looking for all multiplicative functions $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ such that $f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.

The multiplicative property is $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$.

Step 1: Determine $f(0)$ and $f(1)$.
Using the additive property with $x=0$:
$$f(0+1) = f(0) + 1$$
$$f(1) = f(0) + 1 \quad (*)$$

Using the multiplicative property:
$$f(x \cdot 0) = f(x)f(0)$$
$$f(0) = f(x)f(0)$$
This must hold for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.

Case 1: $f(0) \neq 0$.
Then we can divide by $f(0)$, which gives $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.
Let's check if $f(x) = 1$ satisfies the conditions.
Multiplicative: $f(xy) = 1$, $f(x)f(y) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$. (Satisfied)
Additive: $f(x+1) = 1$, $f(x) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.
Since $1 \neq 2$, $f(x) = 1$ is not a solution.
Therefore, we must have $f(0) = 0$.

Case 2: $f(0) = 0$.
From $(*)$, we get $f(1) = 0 + 1 = 1$.

Step 2: Determine $f(n)$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$:
$f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.
$f(3) = f(2+1) = f(2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.
By induction, assume $f(n) = n$.
$f(n+1) = f(n) + 1 = n + 1$.
So, $f(n) = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$.

For $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{<0}$, let $n = -m$ where $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
Since $f(1) = 1$, and $f(1) = f((-1)(-1)) = f(-1)f(-1) = (f(-1))^2$.
$1 = (f(-1))^2$, so $f(-1) = 1$ or $f(-1) = -1$.

Using the additive property:
$f(0) = f(-1+1) = f(-1) + 1$.
Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $0 = f(-1) + 1$, so $f(-1) = -1$.

Now, for $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{<0}$, $n = -m$ where $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
$f(n) = f(-m) = f(-1 \cdot m) = f(-1)f(m)$.
Since $f(-1) = -1$ and $f(m) = m$, we have $f(n) = (-1)m = -m = n$.
Thus, $f(n) = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Step 3: Determine $f(x)$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.
Let $x = p/q$ where $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $q \in \mathbb{N}$.
Since $x = p/q$, we have $qx = p$.
Using the multiplicative property:
$$f(qx) = f(p)$$
Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, we can write $q = 1 \cdot q$.
$f(q) = f(1 \cdot q) = f(1)f(q) = 1 \cdot f(q)$. This is not helpful.

Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, we know $f(q) = q$ and $f(p) = p$.
$$f(q x) = f(q) f(x)$$
$$f(p) = q f(x)$$
$$p = q f(x)$$
Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, $q \neq 0$, we can divide by $q$:
$$f(x) = \frac{p}{q}$$
Since $x = p/q$, we have $f(x) = x$.

Step 4: Verify the solution $f(x) = x$.
1. Multiplicative property:
$$f(xy) = xy$$
$$f(x)f(y) = x y$$
$f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$. (Satisfied)

2. Additive property:
$$f(x+1) = x+1$$
$$f(x) + 1 = x + 1$$
$f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$. (Satisfied)

The only function satisfying the given conditions is $f(x) = x$.

Final check on the derivation of $f(x) = x$:
We used $f(qx) = f(q)f(x)$. This requires $q$ to be a rational number. Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, it is rational.
We used $f(q) = q$ and $f(p) = p$. This was established for all integers $p$ and natural numbers $q$.
The derivation $f(x) = p/q = x$ is sound.

The set of all such functions is $\{f(x) = x\}$.

$$f(0) = f(x)f(0)$$

Additive: $f(x+1) = 1$, $f(x) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.
Since $1 \neq 2$, $f(x) = 1$ is not a solution.
Therefore, we must have $f(0) = 0$.

Case 2: $f(0) = 0$.
From $(*)$, we get $f(1) = 0 + 1 = 1$.

Step 2: Determine $f(n)$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$:
$f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.
$f(3) = f(2+1) = f(2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.
By induction, assume $f(n) = n$.
$f(n+1) = f(n) + 1 = n + 1$.
So, $f(n) = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$.

For $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{<0}$, let $n = -m$ where $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
Since $f(1) = 1$, and $f(1) = f((-1)(-1)) = f(-1)f(-1) = (f(-1))^2$.
$1 = (f(-1))^2$, so $f(-1) = 1$ or $f(-1) = -1$.

Using the additive property:
$f(0) = f(-1+1) = f(-1) + 1$.
Since $f(0) = 0$, we have $0 = f(-1) + 1$, so $f(-1) = -1$.

Now, for $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{<0}$, $n = -m$ where $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
$f(n) = f(-m) = f(-1 \cdot m) = f(-1)f(m)$.
Since $f(-1) = -1$ and $f(m) = m$, we have $f(n) = (-1)m = -m = n$.
Thus, $f(n) = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Step 3: Determine $f(x)$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$.
Let $x = p/q$ where $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $q \in \mathbb{N}$.
Since $x = p/q$, we have $qx = p$.
Using the multiplicative property:
$$f(qx) = f(p)$$
Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, we can write $q = 1 \cdot q$.
$f(q) = f(1 \cdot q) = f(1)f(q) = 1 \cdot f(q)$. This is not helpful.

Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, we know $f(q) = q$ and $f(p) = p$.
$$f(q x) = f(q) f(x)$$
$$f(p) = q f(x)$$
$$p = q f(x)$$
Since $q \in \mathbb{N}$, $q \neq 0$, we can divide by $q$:
$$f(x) = \frac{p}{q}$$
Since $x = p/q$, we have $f(x) = x$.

Step 4: Verify the solution $f(x) = x$.
1. Multiplicative property:
$$f(xy) = xy$$
$$f(x)f(y) = x y$$
$f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$. (Satisfied)

2. Additive property:
$$f(x+1) = x+1$$
$$f(x) + 1 = x + 1$$
$f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$. (Satisfied)

The only function satisfying the given conditions is $f(x) = x$.
